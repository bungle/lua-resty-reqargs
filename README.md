# lua-resty-reqargs

Helper to Retrieve `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, and `application/json` Request Arguments.

## Synopsis

```lua
local get, post, files = require "resty.reqargs"()
if not get then
    error(post)
end
-- Use get, post, and files...
```

## Installation

Just place [`reqargs.lua`](https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-reqargs/blob/master/lib/resty/reqargs.lua)
somewhere in your `package.path`, under `resty` directory. If you are using OpenResty, the default location
would be `/usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty`.

### Using OpenResty Package Manager (opm)

```Shell
$ opm get bungle/lua-resty-reqargs
```

### Using LuaRocks

```Shell
$ luarocks install lua-resty-reqargs
```

LuaRocks repository for `lua-resty-reqargs` is located at https://luarocks.org/modules/bungle/lua-resty-reqargs.

## API

This module has only one function, and that function is loaded with require:

```lua
local reqargs = require "resty.reqargs"
```

### get, post, files regargs(options)

When you call the function (`reqargs`) you can pass it `options`. These
options override whatever you may have defined in your Nginx configuration
(or the defaults). You may use the following options:

```lua
{
    tmp_dir          = "/tmp",
    timeout          = 1000,
    chunk_size       = 4096,
    max_get_args     = 100,
    mas_post_args    = 100,
    max_line_size    = 512,
    max_file_size    = 10240,
    max_file_uploads = 10
}
```

This function will return three (3) return values, and they are called
`get`, `post`,  and `files`. These are Lua tables containing the data
that was (HTTP) requested. `get` contains HTTP request GET arguments
retrieved with [ngx.req.get_uri_args](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqget_uri_args).
`post` contains either HTTP request POST arguments retrieved with
[ngx.req.get_post_args](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqget_post_args),
or in case of `application/json` (as a content type header for the request),
it will read the request body and decode the JSON, and the `post` will
then contain the decoded JSON structure presented as Lua tables. The
last return value `files` contains all the files uploaded. The `files`
return value will only contain data when there are actually files uploaded
and that the request content type is set to `multipart/form-data`. `files`
has the same structure as `get` and `post` for the keys, but the values
are presented as a Lua tables, that look like this (think about PHP's `$_FILES`):

```lua
{
    -- The name of the file upload form field (same as the key)
    name = "photo",
    -- The name of the file that the user selected for the upload
    file = "cat.jpg",
    -- The mimetype of the uploaded file
    type = "image/jpeg"
    -- The file size of the uploaded file (in bytes)
    size = 123465
    -- The location where the uploaded file was streamed
    temp = "/tmp/????"
}
```

In case of error, this function will return `nil`, `error message`.

## Nginx Configuration Variables

You can configure several aspects of `lua-resty-reqargs` directly from
the Nginx configuration, here are the configuration values that you may
use, and their default values:

```nginx
# the default is the system temp dir
set $reqargs_tmp_dir           /tmp;
# see https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-upload
set $reqargs_timeout           1000;
# see https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-upload
set $reqargs_chunk_size        4096;
# see https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqget_uri_args
set $reqargs_max_get_args      100;
# see https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxreqget_post_args
set $reqargs_max_post_args     100;
# see https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-upload
set $reqargs_max_line_size     512;  
# the default is unlimited
set $reqargs_max_file_size     10240;
# the default is unlimited
set $reqargs_max_file_uploads  10;
```
